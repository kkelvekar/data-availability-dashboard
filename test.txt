Subject: DaDashboard Backend API Development Progress Update

Dear Team,

I am pleased to inform you that today I successfully deployed the DaDashboard API on the Development environment, incorporating both the new database integration and GraphQL API integration. The published URL for the Backend API is:

Clarification on Deployment Timeline
There seems to be a misunderstanding at the management level regarding the deployment of DaDashboard components in the Development environment. To clarify, the first version of the Backend API with Mock Data was deployed to the Development environment on January 27, 2025. This update was communicated during daily stand-ups and multiple Teams groups. Additionally, this Mock API was demonstrated in the previous sprint review meeting, which unfortunately some management members could not attend.

Current Achievements with the Latest API Release
With this latest release, we have achieved the following:
✅ Real Data Retrieval: The API can now return actual data in a flat format, fetched dynamically from downstream GraphQL APIs.
✅ Downstream API Testing: This release allows us to validate all versions of downstream APIs in both Development and QA environments.
✅ Preparation for QA Release: I will deploy this version to QA tomorrow, allowing us to verify that the downstream APIs are delivering the expected results. This will help provide a go-ahead to the Data Pod for their release.
✅ Frontend Integration Unblocked: Irina can now integrate this API with the Neo application, enabling her to display real data on the frontend, resolving her previous blocker.

Discrepancies Found in Downstream GraphQL APIs
While testing the integration, we identified the following discrepancies in downstream GraphQL APIs in the Development environment:
🔹 Transactions API – With the current Azure AD scope, this API is not authenticating. It requires adjustments either from our side or from the Data POD team.
🔹 Security API – This API does not accept a date parameter in the query, resulting in it fetching all data for the last few days, leading to slower response times.

Backend API Performance Considerations
Our backend API is designed to optimize performance by sending approximately 16 asynchronous requests to 6 different GraphQL APIs for 16 different entities.

We have maximized performance on our end by implementing parallel asynchronous requests, meaning all requests are sent simultaneously and awaited together.
However, despite these optimizations, we still observe considerable response delays from GraphQL APIs. This could be due to the high volume of requests they receive.
To further improve performance, the Data POD team may need to optimize their APIs to handle concurrent requests more efficiently.
Pending Work on DaDashboard API
Although this release marks significant progress, the following enhancements are still in progress:
🔹 Security Implementation: Currently, the API allows anonymous access. I will implement authentication and authorization controls on the API controllers. However, the API already interacts securely with the new database and GraphQL APIs using authentication.
🔹 Unit Testing & Error Handling: Improved test coverage and enhanced error handling will be added.
🔹 Code Refactoring: Minor optimizations and refinements will be made for better maintainability.

These pending tasks are on track and will be completed by the committed date of February 21, 2025, or potentially earlier. The Backend API development timeline is aligned with our initial planning.

Next Steps
📌 From tomorrow, Irina can begin API integration into the Neo application.
📌 In parallel, I will focus on the security implementation and aim to push it to the Development environment by Tuesday or Wednesday.
📌 Once security is in place, we can test the API integration with Neo, including authentication and authorization.
📌 Cosmetic refinements will follow, leading up to the final Development and QA release of the Backend API on February 21, 2025.
📌 This ensures that QA testing can commence on February 24, 2025 as planned.

I hope this update clarifies the current status and next steps. Please feel free to reach out if any further details are needed.

Best regards,
